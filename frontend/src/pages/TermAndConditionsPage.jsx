      <h2>LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
      <p>
        We limit our liability as much as legally allowed when executing agreements with you. This means our
        responsibility for damages is reduced to the maximum extent permitted by law unless explicitly stated otherwise
        or agreed upon with you.
      </p>
      <h4>Indemnification</h4>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify us and our affiliates, officers, directors, and employees from any claims or demands made
        by third parties due to or in connection with any culpable violation of these terms or third-party rights
        related to your use of the service to the extent allowed by law.
      </p>
      <h4>Limitation of liability</h4>
      <p>
        Unless explicitly stated otherwise and subject to applicable law, you cannot claim damages against us (or any
        individual or entity acting on our behalf).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this exclusion does not apply to damages affecting life, health, or physical integrity, damages arising
        from the breach of significant contractual obligations (such as those necessary to fulfill the contract's
        purpose), and/or damages resulting from intentional or gross negligence, provided that our website has been used
        appropriately and correctly by you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless damages stem from intentional or gross negligence, or they impact life, health, or physical integrity,
        our liability is limited to typical and foreseeable damages at the time the contract was entered into.
      </p>
      <h3>US users</h3>
      <h4>Disclaimer of warranties</h4>
      <p>
        Our website is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. When you use our service, you are doing so at
        your own risk. We explicitly state that we are not making any promises or guarantees, whether they are express,
        implied, or even required by law. These include assurances about the quality of the service, its suitability for
        your specific needs, or whether it infringes on anyone else's rights. Please keep in mind that any advice or
        information you receive from us or through our service does not create any warranties beyond what we have
        explicitly stated here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, while we strive to provide accurate and reliable content, we cannot guarantee that it is always
        going to be the case. We do not guarantee that the service will always meet your requirements or be available
        when you need it. There might be interruptions, or it might not function correctly due to factors beyond our
        control. While we do our best to keep everything running smoothly, we cannot ensure that the service will be
        free of harmful elements like viruses. If you choose to download any content from our service, you are assuming
        the risk, and we are not responsible for any damage it might cause to your devices or data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not endorse or guarantee any products or services advertised through our service or any links we provide.
        We are not involved in any transactions between you and third-party providers, so any interactions or agreements
        you make with them are solely your responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our service might not always be accessible or may not work correctly with your web browser, mobile device, or
        operating system. While we strive to provide a seamless experience, we cannot guarantee it in every situation.
        As such, we want to clarify that we cannot be held responsible for any perceived or actual damages that result
        from issues related to the content, operation, or use of our service.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we may have certain exclusions and limitations in our agreement, these may not apply to you depending on
        the laws of your jurisdiction. Federal law, as well as laws in some states and other jurisdictions, may offer
        protections that supersede our disclaimers and exclusions. This means that you may have specific legal rights
        that are not affected by our agreement. It is essential to understand your rights, as they may vary from state
        to state or country to country. We want to emphasize that any disclaimers or exclusions in our agreement will
        only be enforced to the extent permitted by applicable law.
      </p>
      <h4>Limitation of liability</h4>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall we, along with our subsidiaries,
        affiliates, officers, directors, agents, partners, suppliers, or employees, be liable for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This limitation of liability section will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable
        jurisdiction whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any
        other basis, even if you have been advised of the possibility of such damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that in some jurisdictions, the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages may
        not be allowed. This means that these limitations or exclusions might not apply to you. You have specific legal
        rights, which may vary depending on your jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability
        outlined here may not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>COMMON PROVISIONS</h2>
      <h3>No waiver</h3>
      <p>
        Our failure to assert any right or provision under these terms does not waive that right or provision. No waiver

      </p>
      <h3>Changes to the terms</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time, informing you of any changes.</p>

        document.
      </p>
      <h3>Severability</h3>
      <p>
        Invalidity or unenforceability of any provision under applicable law will not affect the validity of other
        provisions, which will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <h4>US users</h4>
      <p>
        Any invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted to the extent reasonably required to render it valid,
        enforceable, and consistent with its original intent. This document constitutes the entire agreement between you
        and us and supersedes all other communications, including but not limited to prior agreements concerning such
        subject matter, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
      </p>
      <h4>EU users</h4>
      <p>
        If any provision of this document is void, invalid, or unenforceable, we both agree to do our best to find, in
        an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions. <br />
        In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid, or unenforceable provisions will be replaced by the applicable
        statutory provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of the above, the nullity, invalidity, or impossibility of enforcing a particular provision of this
        document will not nullify the entire agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential for it, or of such
        importance that we both would not have entered into the contract if we had known that the provision would not be
        valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship for you or us.
      </p>
      <h3>Governing law</h3>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the law of the place where we are based, as outlined in the relevant section of this
        document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.
      </p>
      <h4>Prevalence of national law</h4>
      <p>
        However, regardless of the above, if the law of the country that you are based on provides for higher applicable
        consumer protection standards, such higher standards will prevail.
      </p>
      <h3>Venue of jurisdiction</h3>
      <p>
        The jurisdiction over any controversy related to these terms lies with the courts of the place where we are
        based, as outlined in the relevant section of this document.
      </p>
      <h4>Exception for consumers in Europe</h4>
      <p>
        However, regardless of the above, this does not apply if you qualify as a European consumer or if you are a
        consumer based in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, or Iceland.
      </p>
      <h4>UK consumers</h4>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer based in England and Wales, you may bring legal proceedings related to these terms in the
        English and Welsh courts. If you are a consumer based in Scotland, you may bring legal proceedings in either the
        Scottish or the English courts. If you are a consumer based in Northern Ireland, you may bring legal proceedings
        in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.
      </p>
      <h4>US users</h4>
      <p>
        We both agree to waive any right to trial by jury in any court in connection with any action or litigation.{' '}
        <br />
        Any claims under these terms shall proceed individually and we both agree not to join in a class action or other
